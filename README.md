Peer-to-peer voice journal
==========================

This is an example of a decentrazlised voice journal which uses the `dat://`
protocol to distribute recordings. All audio files are created via calling
a virtual number powered by the [Nexmo Voice API](https://nexmo.com).

Each person who views the site becomes a peer, helping to distribute the site
to other users and ensuring the recordings always remain online. Their is no
central server required in order to serve the site and audio.
